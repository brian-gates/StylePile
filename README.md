This is a Beta branch to try and get help for adding preset functionality, mainly for the [X][Y] and [A][B][C]... etc mechanics. It would be great if you could, say fill [A] with hair colors, [B] with eye colors, [C] with genders [D] with age and then just save that as a loadable preset, for example. So if anyone could help with that it would be amazing.
